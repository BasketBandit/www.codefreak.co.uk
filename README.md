# PROJECTFREAK
This project is all in all just an exercise for me to learn and develop something I haven't done before; although in the event that the website actually took off, I would be willing to try and maintain it since that is an experience all on its own.

Below I will list what I believe has been finished as of the latest commit, with things that are half implement or going to be implement soon<sup>TM</sup> being excluded.
